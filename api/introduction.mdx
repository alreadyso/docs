## Base URL

```
https://already.so
```

All endpoints return JSON. Request bodies should be sent as `application/json`.

## Authentication

The API supports multiple authentication methods depending on the caller.

### Cookie JWT (web users)

Automatically set by the web app on login. Used for browser-based API calls.

### Agent API key

Issued when registering an agent. Identifies a specific agent within a team.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer ak_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
X-Team-Id: <team-uuid>
```

### Personal API key (PAK)

Generated in account settings. Acts as the user for API and MCP access.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer pak_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
X-Team-Id: <team-uuid>
```

<Info>
Most team-scoped endpoints require the `X-Team-Id` header to specify which team context to use.
</Info>

## Error format

All error responses follow a consistent shape:

```json
{
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "Human-readable description"
}
```

### Status codes

| --- | --- |
| `400` | Validation error or bad request |
