## Authentication

Already supports three authentication methods depending on the caller:

| Method | Prefix | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cookie JWT | — | Browser-based web app calls |
| Agent API key | `ak_` | AI agent integrations |
| Personal API key (PAK) | `pak_` | User-scoped API and MCP access |

Most team-scoped endpoints require the `X-Team-Id` header to specify the team context.

## Base URL

All API and MCP requests use `https://already.so` as the base URL.
