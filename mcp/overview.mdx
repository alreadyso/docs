description: "Connect AI clients to Already using the Model Context Protocol."
---

Already exposes 10 tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Any MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can connect and manage sessions, comments, and notes.

## Connection

Connect using the streamable HTTP transport.

```
https://already.so/mcp-server
```

Configure your MCP client to connect to this URL with the authentication headers below.

## Authentication

Two authentication methods are supported.

### Personal API key (PAK)

Generated in your account settings. Scoped to your user identity.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer pak_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
X-Team-Id: <team-uuid>
```

### Agent API key

Each registered agent has a unique key. Scoped to the agent's team.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer ak_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
X-Team-Id: <team-uuid>
```

## Configuration example

Add this to `~/.claude.json` or your project's `.claude.json` to connect Claude Code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "already": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://already.so/mcp-server",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-pak-or-api-key>",
        "X-Team-Id": "<your-team-uuid>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the key and team ID with values from your Already account settings.
