---

The `/already` skill lets Claude Code pull work from Already sessions and execute it directly in your terminal. Record a voice note, attach a screenshot, or type a task — then run `/already` and Claude handles the rest.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** CLI installed (`npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Already **MCP server** configured in Claude Code (see [MCP overview](/mcp/overview))
- A **Personal API Key** (PAK) or agent API key from Already

## MCP server configuration

Add the Already MCP server to your Claude Code config. Put this in `~/.claude.json` or your project's `.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "already": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://already.so/mcp-server",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-pak-or-api-key>",
        "X-Team-Id": "<your-team-uuid>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the key and team ID with values from your Already account settings.

## Installation

Copy the skill file to your Claude Code skills directory.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Global install">
    Installs for all projects.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/already
    curl -o ~/.claude/skills/already/SKILL.md \
      https://already.so/skills/claude/already/SKILL.md
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project-level install">
    Installs for the current project only.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p .claude/skills/already
    curl -o .claude/skills/already/SKILL.md \
      https://already.so/skills/claude/already/SKILL.md
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Restart Claude Code after installing. The `/already` command will appear in your slash-command list.

## Usage

Three modes depending on the arguments you pass.

### List mode

```
/already list
```

Lists the 20 most recent sessions with status, priority, title, assignee, and labels. No work is performed.

```
Recent Sessions (20)
─────────────────────
[~] High   | Fix auth redirect bug    | @alice | bug,auth  | a1b2c3d4
[ ] Normal | Add dark mode support    |        | feature   | e5f6g7h8
[x] Low    | Update README            | @bob   | docs      | i9j0k1l2
```

### Auto mode

```
/already
```

Picks up the most recent `todo` session, marks it `in_progress`, reads all context (notes, comments, attachments), executes the work, then updates the status and adds a completion comment.

### Specific mode

```
/already <session-id>
```

Same as auto mode but targets a specific session by its UUID. Use this after running `/already list` to pick a particular task.

## Workflow

What happens when the skill executes work on a session:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch context">
    Reads the session's title, description, notes (including voice transcriptions), comments, and attachment list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download attachments">
    Screenshots, PDFs, and other files are downloaded to `/tmp` and viewed so Claude has full visual context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute work">
    Based on the gathered context, Claude performs the requested task (writing code, fixing bugs, creating files, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update status">
    The session is marked `done` or `needs_feedback` and a summary comment is added.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

**Fix a bug from a voice note** — Record a voice note in Already describing a bug. The session is created with your transcription in the notes. Run `/already` and Claude reads the transcription, understands the issue, fixes it, and marks the session done with a comment explaining the fix.

**Work through a backlog** — Run `/already list` to see what's pending, then `/already <id>` to pick a specific task, or just `/already` repeatedly to work through todos in order.

**Screenshot-driven UI changes** — Attach a screenshot to a session with annotations showing what to change. Claude downloads and views the screenshot, then implements the UI changes to match.
