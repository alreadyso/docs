Webhooks let you receive real-time HTTP notifications when events happen in your team — sessions created, status changes, comments, and more. Configure webhook endpoints per team, and Already will POST signed JSON payloads to your URL.

## Setup

Use the [webhook API endpoints](/api/webhooks) to register a webhook URL for your team. You can subscribe to specific event types or receive all events.

```bash
POST /api/webhooks
```

```json
{
  "name": "My webhook",
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "event_types": ["session.created", "session.status_changed"],
  "secret": "your-signing-secret"
}
```

## Payload structure

Every webhook delivery has the same top-level structure.

<ResponseField name="event" type="string" required>
  The event type (e.g. `session.created`)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="timestamp" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="delivery_id" type="string" required>
  Unique ID for this delivery (UUID)
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="data" type="object" required>
  Event-specific payload (see [event types](/webhooks/events))
</ResponseField>

```json
{
  "event": "session.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "delivery_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "data": {
    "session": { "..." },
    "created_by": null
  }
}
```

## Signature verification

Each delivery includes an HMAC-SHA256 signature computed with your webhook secret.

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | `sha256=<hex-digest>` — HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your secret |
| `X-Webhook-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp (seconds) of when the payload was signed |

### Verification steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the raw body">
    Read the raw request body (do not parse JSON first).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compute HMAC">
    Compute HMAC-SHA256 of the body using your webhook secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare signatures">
    Compare with the signature in `X-Webhook-Signature` (after stripping the `sha256=` prefix).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check timestamp">
    Verify that `X-Webhook-Timestamp` is within 5 minutes of the current time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Delivery and retries

Already expects a `2xx` response within **30 seconds**.

Failed deliveries are retried up to **3 times** with exponential backoff:

| Retry | Delay |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 second |
| 2 | 5 seconds |
| 3 | 30 seconds |
